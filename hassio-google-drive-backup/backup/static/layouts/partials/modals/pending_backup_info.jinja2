    <h4>Pending Backup Info</h4>
    <p>This addon thinks a backup is in progress, but that just an assumption.  In reality Home Assistant doesn't tell this addon the reason the 
      request to create a backup was rejected, a backup already being in progress is just the most common reason.  A lot of less common reasons can cause it to be rejected like

      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>You're using a network share to store backups, and its unavailable</li>
        <li>Something is wrong with your hard drive and Home Assistant can't read/write to it</li>
        <li>Home Assistant has frozen itself because it thinks something is wrong</li>
      </ul>
      The only place these less common errors show up is in the Supervisor's logs.  The Supervisor is a part of Home Assistant that manages it in the background.  Its logs are 
      kind of hard to get to, so for conveinence a snapshot of the logs right after the backup was most recently requested is shown below.  If you're seeing a backup thats stuck 
      in the "pending" state, these logs might provide a clue why.  If you're able to identify and resolve that problem, restart this addon to have it try creating a backup again.</p>
